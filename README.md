## Goals for this project:

- Practise React
- Make a working application.
- Preapare for a job assignment
- Learn React Beaultiful DND library
- Showcase some of what I can do and get a job as a junior developer.

## Requirements

The todo application shall consist out of a single view and be implemented as a single page application, background requests are preferred over page reloads. Within the view, there should be a list of all currently existing todo tasks and an easy interface to add a new todo task, i.e., two input fields to add a name as well as a description for a new task and a button to save the new task. Besides adding a new task, one should be able to tick existing tasks, such that the application marks these tasks as done. Please make your todo application persistent across page reloads by adding a basic API endpoint or Local Storage that can store a new task and return all available tasks

## What will be evaluated

- Clean and understandable code,
- Overall structure and concept of the application
- Maintainability and test-ability of the code -
- Extend-ability of the application with further features and
-Overall familiarity with the coding language and ecosystem
